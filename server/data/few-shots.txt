  "patientPresentation": "Patient appears confused and repetitive in conversation, cycling through the same three questions. Staff state she normally engages well in conversation but began acting 'off' after breakfast. She is cooperative but slow to answer and appears jittery.",
  "incidentHistory": {
    "narrative": "Staff called 911 after noticing Ms. Morris asking repeatedly about breakfast, despite having already eaten.

A half-empty juice box sits on a table nearby. A glucometer is sitting unused next to a staff charting tablet.",

    "If oral glucose is administered promptly: Patient regains full orientation within 10–15 minutes, reports feeling better, and becomes conversational. BGL increases appropriately, tremors resolve.",

    "If physical exam and vitals are not reassessed: Early improvement or deterioration is missed; patient may either worsen or show rebound hypoglycemia if treated inappropriately.",
