# Ontario Basic Life Support Patient Care Standards (BLS PCS v3.4 – 2023) Key Directives and Thresholds for Paramedic Scenario Generation

## Oxygen Administration (BLS PCS)
- Do NOT administer oxygen if the patient has an SpO₂ of 94% or greater AND shows no signs of hypoxia.
- Initiate oxygen therapy if:
  - SpO₂ is below 94%
  - OR signs of hypoxia or respiratory distress are present (cyanosis, altered mental status, poor perfusion, shock, or poor waveform).
- Titrate oxygen to maintain an SpO₂ of 92–96% unless otherwise directed.
- Use appropriate delivery method (nasal cannula, non-rebreather, BVM) based on severity and directive.

Airway Management:
- Provide airway support in this order:
  • Positioning → suction → OPA/NPA → BVM → supraglottic (if PCP authorized)
- Monitor for effectiveness and reassess airway status frequently.

Cardiac Arrest (CPR/AED):
- Begin CPR immediately if no pulse or signs of life.
- Attach AED ASAP and follow prompts.
- Minimize interruptions.
- PCPs should follow TOR (Termination of Resuscitation) protocol as outlined.

## Vital Signs Required
- All patients must have full vitals taken unless unsafe or impractical:
  - Heart Rate (HR)
  - Respiratory Rate (RR)
  - Blood Pressure (BP)
  - SpO₂
  - Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
  - Skin condition (color, moisture, temperature)
  - Pupils (if neurological concern, trauma, or head injury)
  - Blood Glucose Level (if AMS, seizure, stroke, or suspected diabetes)
  - ETCO₂ (if airway adjuncts, ventilation, or ALS monitor available)
  - Temperature (if infection, fever, sepsis, or environmental emergency suspected)

## Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) Standard
- Apply SMR if the patient has:
  - GCS <15
  - over the age of 65 with history of a fall
  - Spine pain or tenderness
  - Neurological deficits (numbness, weakness, paralysis)
  - Distracting injury (e.g., long bone fracture)
  - Dangerous mechanism of injury:
    - Fall >3 feet or 5 stairs
    - Axial load (diving)
    - Rollover MVC
    - Ejection from vehicle
    - High-speed collision
- Do NOT use spinal boards for transport.
- Use stretcher and 3-strap immobilization.
- Document SMR application, criteria met, and patient response.

## Blood Glucose Testing
- Required in the following presentations:
  - Altered mental status (GCS <15)
  - Suspected diabetic emergency
  - Seizure
  - Suspected stroke or TIA
- Must document BGL value and time taken.
- Use glucometer per local service protocol.

## Refusal of Service Criteria
- Paramedics may permit refusal only if patient has:
  - Capacity (alert, oriented, able to understand and communicate decision)
  - No emergent condition requiring intervention
  - Informed of risks and consequences
  - Documented consent and assessment
- Must offer transport and fully explain risks of refusal.
- Document:
  - Patient’s decision-making capacity
  - Risks explained and understood
  - Final decision and alternative options offered

## Transport Decision Rules
- Immediate transport advised if:
  - Patient is unresponsive
  - Actively seizing
  - Has airway compromise or needs assisted ventilation
  - Hemodynamically unstable or in shock
  - Has massive external hemorrhage
  - Presents with major trauma or penetrating injuries
  - Stroke symptoms within window for thrombolysis

## Scene Safety and PPE Requirements
- Scene safety must be confirmed before patient contact.
- Paramedics must:
  - Identify environmental, chemical, biological, or behavioral hazards
  - Wear appropriate PPE for respiratory, bleeding, or contamination risk
  - Request fire or police assistance when safety or access is compromised
  - Maintain personal and team safety as the top priority

  ## Mental Health 
  Patient in Crisis:
- Ensure scene safety.
- Use de-escalation techniques.
- Apply BLS protocols and contact police/mental health team as required.

## Additional BLS Expectations
- Reassessment is required every 5–10 minutes or after any intervention.
- Ensure ongoing documentation of patient response, vitals, and treatment.
- Use appropriate communication protocols with allied agencies and hospitals.
