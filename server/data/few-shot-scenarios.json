    "scenarioIntro": "ðŸ§  **Teacherâ€™s Points**: This case emphasizes gentle handling, strong scene awareness, and trauma suspicion in the elderly. Pelvic fractures are notoriously unstableâ€”students must understand the hidden risk of retroperitoneal bleeding. Look for how they manage this quiet crisis: do they communicate clearly, stabilize effectively, and think through extrication options? Itâ€™s less about cool skills and more about thoughtful, patient-centered care. A good takeaway: 'Not all trauma is loud.'",
