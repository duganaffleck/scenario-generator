    "withProperTreatment": "If managed appropriately (support presenting part, rapid transport, notify receiving hospital), patient and fetus remain stable. Delivery does not progress further en route.",
    "withoutProperTreatment": "If excessive traction is applied or transport is delayed, fetal distress may occur. Umbilical cord prolapse or head entrapment may develop, increasing neonatal morbidity risk."
  },
  "expectedTreatment": "Do NOT attempt to deliver breech presentation in field unless head is crowning. Support presenting part with sterile towel, elevate hips, and expedite transport. Notify receiving facility en route. Monitor vitals and contractions. *(ðŸ’¡ This is a time-critical OB emergency â€” support, donâ€™t intervene.)*",
  "protocolNotes": "Per BLS PCS, breech presentation with visible limb is a high-risk obstetrical emergency â€” prioritize immediate transport and avoid delivery maneuvers.",
  "scenarioRationale": "Designed to prepare students for rare but high-stakes OB emergencies. Highlights need for calm leadership, rapid decision-making, and adherence to scope.",
  "clinicalReasoning": "Incomplete breech delivery poses significant risk of cord prolapse or head entrapment. Without full dilation or buttocks presentation, transport is safest. Do not attempt to deliver in field unless birth is imminent and head is crowning.",

    "Breech Delivery (incomplete)": "Most likely â€” confirmed by visible limb",
    "Precipitous Labor": "Possible, especially for primigravida with rapid progression",
    "Cord Prolapse": "High risk due to breech â€” monitor fetal tone and vitals",
    "Normal Labor": "Unlikely â€” abnormal presentation confirmed visually"
